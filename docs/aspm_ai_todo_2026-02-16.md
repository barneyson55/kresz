Top 3 actionable productization tasks for this rotation:

1. [ ] Add a deterministic CI pipeline (lint/test/build) and expose status badge in README for buyer confidence.
2. [ ] Create one end-to-end smoke test for the primary user journey and wire it into CI.
3. [ ] Define a release checklist with version bump, QA gate, rollback plan, and release notes template.

Execution note:
- Keep tasks concrete, buyer-facing, and measurable.
